- receive data from Twitter Streaming API
- output tweets to kafka topic
  - key = userId String
  - value = Tweet
  - key & value need to be serialized using confluent avro serializers
    - hooked up to schema registry
    - key is just a primitive
    - value
      - we'll receive some twitter4j Status object from streaming api
      - just need to convert that to a GenericRecord or SpecificRecord to serialize to kafka topic
      - just pull out some main tweet fields (e.g. id, text, timestamp, etc) for now

- should this also impl user service?
  - status obj have both tweet and user data
  - this service could also write to users kafka topic
